# Project Tracker Backend API

A comprehensive backend API for the Murang'a County Project Tracker system, built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.

## üéØ Project Overview

This backend serves a project tracking system for Murang'a County with three user roles:
- **PUBLIC**: Can view projects and comment
- **STAFF**: Can manage assigned projects and respond to comments
- **ADMIN**: Full system access and user management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, helmet, CORS

## üìã Development Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema Design ‚úÖ

**Achievements:**
- Designed comprehensive database schema with three main entities
- Implemented proper relationships between User, Project, and Comment models
- Added audit trail fields for tracking who created/edited projects
- Created role-based enum system (PUBLIC, STAFF, ADMIN)

**Schema Structure:**
```prisma
model User {
  id, name, email, password, role, createdAt, updatedAt
  projects (as staff), comments, editedProjects, createdProjects
}

model Project {
  id, title, description, status, priority, dueDate, createdAt, updatedAt
  staffId, createdById, lastEditedById
  staff, createdBy, lastEditedBy, comments
}

model Comment {
  id, content, createdAt, updatedAt
  userId, projectId
  user, project
}
```

**Problems Encountered:**
- Initial schema had only USER/ADMIN roles, needed to add STAFF role
- Missing audit trail fields for project tracking
- Schema relationships needed clarification for staff assignment

**Solutions:**
- Updated Role enum to include PUBLIC, STAFF, ADMIN
- Added createdById and lastEditedById fields to Project model
- Implemented proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes

### Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization ‚úÖ

**Achievements:**
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Created comprehensive middleware for role-based access control
- Added project ownership verification for staff members
- Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt

**Features Implemented:**
- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and verification
- Role-based route protection
- Project ownership middleware
- Logout functionality

**Problems Encountered:**
- JWT token validation errors due to missing JWT_SECRET
- Route conflicts between different API endpoints
- Middleware parameter extraction issues

**Solutions:**
- Created proper .env file with JWT_SECRET
- Separated route mounting to avoid conflicts (/api/projects, /api/comments, /api/users)
- Fixed middleware to use correct parameter names (req.params.id vs req.params.projectId)

### Phase 3: Project Management ‚úÖ

**Achievements:**
- Complete CRUD operations for projects
- Staff assignment and ownership tracking
- Project filtering and search capabilities
- Audit trail implementation

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/projects` - Get all projects (public)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project by ID (public)
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project (staff/admin)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (staff/admin)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (admin only)
- `GET /api/projects/staff/projects` - Get staff's projects

**Problems Encountered:**
- Project ownership middleware looking for wrong parameter
- Staff assignment validation issues
- Route mounting conflicts

**Solutions:**
- Fixed middleware to use req.params.id instead of req.params.projectId
- Added proper staff role validation in project creation
- Separated route mounting to prevent conflicts

### Phase 4: Comment System ‚úÖ

**Achievements:**
- Complete comment CRUD operations
- Role-based comment permissions
- Comment filtering by project and user
- Proper user authorization for comment management

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/comments/projects/:projectId` - Get project comments (public)
- `POST /api/comments` - Create comment (authenticated users)
- `PUT /api/comments/:id` - Update comment (owner/staff/admin)
- `DELETE /api/comments/:id` - Delete comment (owner/staff/admin)
- `GET /api/comments/users/:userId` - Get user comments

**Permission System:**
- Users can edit/delete their own comments
- Staff can manage comments on their assigned projects
- Admins can manage all comments

### Phase 5: User Management ‚úÖ

**Achievements:**
- Complete user CRUD operations (admin only)
- Role assignment and management
- Staff member listing and statistics
- User activity tracking

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin)
- `GET /api/users/staff` - Get staff members (admin)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (admin)
- `POST /api/users` - Create user (admin)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (admin)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (admin)

**Security Features:**
- Admin cannot delete themselves
- Role validation for user creation/updates
- Email uniqueness validation

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "user_id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "ADMIN|STAFF|PUBLIC",
  iat: timestamp,
  exp: timestamp
}
```

### Middleware Stack
1. **verifyToken**: Validates JWT and adds user to request
2. **requireRole**: Checks if user has required role
3. **requireProjectOwnership**: Verifies staff can access project

### Role Permissions
- **PUBLIC**: View projects, create/edit own comments
- **STAFF**: Manage assigned projects, respond to comments
- **ADMIN**: Full system access, user management
